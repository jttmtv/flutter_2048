2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The gameâ€™s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

2048 is a very classic game, which is more representative of its implementation. Secondly, 2048 is a very lightweight game, and its development difficulty is moderate, so it is suitable as an introductory Flutter project for novices. For these reasons, we chose to implement 2048 with Flutter.

The project is made in **Flutter 3.0** at the moment and is not related in anyway to the Flame Game Engine or the Game toolking the Flutter team released with version 3.0
